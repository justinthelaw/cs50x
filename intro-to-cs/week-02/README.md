# For each `.c` file in this sub-directory, _make_ each file before running the script

## Lab #1

The `scrabble.c` lab requires 2 command line arguments following the `./scrabble` to run the script. The arguments must be strings, as the script runs a scrabble score comparison on the two in order to determine a winner.

## Problem #1

Run `gcc -o readability readability.c -lm` prior to running the script at `./readability "<insert your excerpt here>"` where an excerpt is as many sentences as the user desires.
